# Task Manager 

This app allows you to manage your daily tasks. Here you can create a list of todos, mark them as completed, edit them or delete them.

## Features

* **Add New Task:** give it a title, a date and a description
* **Edit Task:** sometimes we mess things up, just edit it and it's all okey
* **Mark as completed:** That is great! I'm done with it!
* **Delete Task:** the list is getting too long, just delete that one
* **Global state storage:** you refresh the page, donÂ´t worry, your tasks are still there

## How to Install

First, clone the repo with the following:
```
  git@github.com:CursoFullStackAgosto/emiliano-entregable-react.git
```
Now, to make it work, you need to install all the dependencies of the project. Here's another fun list:

* `npm install` (for the node modules and the *json)
* `npm install sass` (for the styles)
* `npm install uuid` (for the id of the todos)
* `npm install react-date-picker` (for a nice date)
* `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux` (to manage a global state)
* `npm install redux-persist` (to store data)

Once you done all that, just hit the command `npm run dev` and we are done!
